| General symptoms                             | ~ 20                          | nan                          | → Their symptoms include muscle wasting (27%); pain, stiffness, or cramps (13%); and pseudohypertrophy (6%). Patients' creatine kinase (CK) levels are, on average, 54 times higher than those of control groups. They typically begin using a cane in their thirties and become wheelchair-bound in their forties or, on average, 21 years after symptom onset. The age at which patients become wheelchair bound ranges from 25 to 54 years (on average 38 years). Among the affected muscles, the gastrocnemius, soleus, and subscapularis are particularly vulnerable in dysferlinopathies, whereas others, such as the levator scapulae, are relatively spared; the underlying cause of this pattern remains unclear. While muscle involvement is generally symmetrical, some patients may exhibit asymmetrical muscle degradation. | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | → Variability in muscle fibre sizes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The phenotype primarily affects skeletal muscles, while the heart remains largely unaffected, with normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram results. However, a three-year study found that up to 30% of patients have a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC), and up to 58% exhibit a cardiac P-wave abnormality, which can increase the risk of atrial flutter. A cardiac MRI study showed subclinical myocardial fibrosis in 33% of patients, which was associated in half of cases with diastolic dysfunction. Many patients develop latent cardiac dysfunction, and a few patients have dilated cardiomyopathy, other cardiac rhythm changes, or left ventricular hypertrophy. One patient died with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and supraventricular tachycardia requiring pacing. In a 23-year follow-up study to investigate disease progression, many patients developed restrictive lung disease with mild obstructive signs in small airways, reduced forced vital capacity, and severe respiratory failure. | nan                                                                                                                                          | Anwar, Saeed, and Toshifumi Yokota. ‘The Dysferlinopathies Conundrum: Clinical Spectra, Disease Mechanism and Genetic Approaches for Treatments’.

According to the most accepted hypothesis, sarcolemmal lesions due to exercise accumulate during the presymptomatic stage of the disease, where they produce molecular signaling of damage and extensive inflammation, leading to fiber damage and necrosis. In one study muscle functional grade 4 of the Gardner-Medwin Walton scale was reached on average 2 years faster in the sports patients than the nonsports patients. Traumatic events may occasionally precipitate the onset of disease.                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | → Presence of necrotic and regenerating fibres                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A distinguishing feature of MM is calf discomfort and pain, which sets it apart from other distal muscular dystrophies. | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                          | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
