# Logical modelling of dysferlinopathies

## 1. Biological background

This section provides the necessary context to understand dysferlinopathies by outlining the structure and function of skeletal muscle—the primary tissue affected by this disease. It also characterizes dysferlin, the protein whose gene mutation is responsible for dysferlinopathies, and examines the cellular and molecular consequences of dysferlin deficiency.

### 1.1 Skeletal muscles

Skeletal muscles are composed of individual muscle fibers that generate and coordinate bodily movements. In addition to their role in locomotion, they contribute to postural maintenance and respiration.

#### Myogenesis and muscle structure  
Muscle development (myogenesis) is a tightly regulated process governed by multiple transcription factors during embryogenesis. Myogenic precursor cells differentiate into myoblasts, which rapidly proliferate. These myoblasts align and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, which then mature into muscle fibers. Mature fibers—elongated cells with peripherally located nuclei—contain numerous myofibrils (the contractile units) and retain a population of quiescent satellite cells that activate upon muscle injury to mediate regeneration.

Muscle fibers are organized into a hierarchical structure:

- **Epimysium:** A dense connective tissue layer that envelops the entire muscle.
- **Fascicles and perimysium:** Bundles of muscle fibers are grouped into fascicles, each surrounded by perimysium, which also houses blood vessels and nerves.
- **Endomysium:** A thin connective tissue layer encasing each individual muscle fiber.

#### Intracellular organization  
The muscle fiber’s plasma membrane (**sarcolemma**) contains transmembrane proteins that link it to sarcomeres, ensuring coordinated contraction. The **sarcoplasm** (intracellular fluid) contains myofibrils, the **sarcoplasmic reticulum** (which regulates calcium for contraction), **mitochondria** (energy production), the **Golgi apparatus** (protein processing), **glycogen** (energy reserve), and **myoglobin** (oxygen storage).

#### Excitation-contraction coupling  
Efficient muscle contraction relies on **triads**—specialized structures formed by a **T-tubule** and two adjacent **terminal cisternae** of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 

### 1.2. Dysferlin

#### 1.2.1 Generalities

Dysferlin is a protein encoded by the **DYSF** gene located at chromosome 2p13. The gene spans over 230 kb on the short arm of chromosome 2 and contains 55 exons ranging from 30 to 461 bp. Through alternative splicing—a process that removes introns and joins exons—14 distinct transcripts encoding various dysferlin isoforms are produced. Notably, four alternative exons (v1, 5a, 17, and 40a) contribute to this diversity, although transcripts containing these alternative exons account for only up to 5% of the total in skeletal muscle. Transcriptomic data indicate that **DYSF** is widely expressed, with the highest levels in skeletal muscle and placenta, while tissues such as cardiac muscle and spleen show moderate expression.

Mutations within the **DYSF** locus, which lead to dysferlin deficiency, are responsible for a form of muscular dystrophy known as dysferlinopathy. Dysferlin is a large transmembrane protein (approximately 237 kDa), with isoform-dependent lengths ranging from 2080 to 2119 amino acids. It contains a single transmembrane segment that anchors it to the plasma membrane, T-tubules, and intracellular vesicles. Structurally, dysferlin features a large cytoplasmic domain composed of seven C2 domains (labeled A–G), three Iron domains, and three DysF domains, in addition to a small extracellular portion.

The C2 domains are critical for binding calcium, interacting with protein partners, and associating with lipid-rich regions. For instance, the C2A domain binds phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner and interacts with membrane fusion partners such as AHNAK, annexin A1, annexin A2, and tubulin. The combined C2B–FerI–C2C motif appears to regulate dysferlin expression and endocytosis at the plasma membrane, while the C2F–C2G–TM motif is implicated in muscle cell membrane repair. The specific roles of the Iron and DysF domains, however, remain to be fully elucidated.

Dysferlin is predominantly localized to the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle, but it is also found in T-tubules and intracellular vesicles. Although its protein expression is highest in skeletal muscle, dysferlin is also detectable—at lower levels—in tissues such as the placenta, kidney, cardiac muscle (cardiomyocytes), spleen (red pulp), bone marrow (hematopoietic cells), testes (seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells), smooth muscle, and colonic endothelial cells. Its expression can be observed as early as 5–6 weeks of human embryonic development and persists throughout life.

#### 1.2.2 Functions

Dysferlin is essential for skeletal muscle function and is involved in several key processes within myofibers, including myoblast/myotube fusion, T-tubule formation and stabilization, vesicle trafficking, and muscle cell membrane repair. In addition, dysferlin contributes to non-muscle functions such as the regulation of inflammatory processes.

**Myoblast/Myotube Fusion**  
Skeletal muscle development, growth, and regeneration depend on the fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. This process involves several coordinated steps:
- **Migration and Contact:** Myoblasts migrate toward each other, guided by chemotactic factors. They extend cellular protrusions (lamellipodia and filopodia) to establish contact. Adhesion is mediated by proteins such as M-cadherin, integrins, and Adam12. For instance, interactions between integrins on myotubes and their receptors on myoblasts facilitate alignment.
- **Fusion Process:** At contact sites, proteins such as myoferlin (abundant in myoblasts) and dysferlin (more prevalent in myotubes) are highly expressed. Actin cytoskeleton remodeling, assisted by myosin 2A, forms a dense scaffold that provides membrane rigidity. Vesicles accumulate at the fusion zone and form fusion pores that enable cytoplasmic continuity between the cells. Dysferlin, which is involved in vesicle trafficking, may help transport vesicles to the fusion site.

Although key proteins have been identified, the exact mechanisms and individual contributions of each protein in myoblast/myotube fusion require further investigation.

**T-Tubule Formation and Stabilization**  
T-tubules are specialized membrane invaginations crucial for rapid transmission of action potentials from the neuromuscular junction to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggering calcium release and muscle contraction. Their formation involves two main steps:
- **Membrane Invagination:** Proteins such as Bin1 and dynamin-2 facilitate the curvature and invagination of the sarcolemma. Bin1 binds to the membrane, and its BAR domain, together with the interaction between its SH3 domain and dynamin-2’s proline-rich domain, is believed to induce membrane curvature.
- **Membrane Extension:** Dysferlin likely assists in extending the invaginated membrane. T-tubule membranes are enriched in PI(4,5)P2 phospholipids, which dysferlin binds with high affinity. Caveolin-3, present in developing T-tubules, may also contribute due to its association with cholesterol-rich domains.

Once formed, T-tubules initially run longitudinally along the myofibril axis before rearranging into a predominantly transverse orientation, a process that involves connections with the SR mediated by proteins such as junctophilin1.

**Vesicle Trafficking**  
Dysferlin plays a role in the intracellular trafficking of vesicles. Evidence for this includes:
- **Animal Models:** Dysferlin-deficient animal models exhibit an accumulation of vesicles within muscle cells.
- **Receptor Recycling:** In dysferlin-lacking myoblasts, the recycling and proper localization of receptors (e.g., IGFR1) are impaired, leading to receptor aggregation.
  
Other proteins, such as MG53 and caveolin-3, also contribute to vesicle trafficking. MG53 associates with intracellular vesicles and promotes their fusion with the plasma membrane, while caveolin-3 appears to regulate MG53 activity by modulating vesicle fusion.

**Muscle Membrane Repair**  
Muscle cell membrane repair is a rapid, calcium-triggered process that involves:
- **Calcium Influx:** Rupture of the plasma membrane causes a sudden increase in intracellular calcium, which initiates a cascade of events.
- **Cytoskeleton Remodelling:** The calcium influx activates calpains that cleave cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and vimentin, leading to the disassembly of the damaged actin network. GTPases (RhoA and Cdc42) then help recruit actin and myosin to form an actomyosin ring that contracts to close the lesion.
- **Microtubule Dynamics:** Calcium also promotes the recruitment of EB1 proteins, aiding in microtubule elongation and the transport of vesicles toward the injury.
- **Exocytosis and Vesicle Fusion:** In response to calcium influx, vesicles (e.g., lysosomes marked by synaptotagmin 7) migrate to and fuse with the plasma membrane, increasing its surface area. This process, supported by motor proteins like kinesin and facilitated by dysferlin, reduces membrane retraction.
- **Membrane Patch Formation:** Active calpains cleave dysferlin at the region encoded by alternative exon 40a, generating mini-dysferlin. Vesicles containing mini-dysferlin accumulate beneath the lesion and fuse with the plasma membrane, with MG53 binding to phosphatidylserine further assisting in vesicle fusion. The resulting "membrane patch" effectively seals the damaged area.

**Calcium Handling**  
Calcium is a critical second messenger in muscle contraction and repair. Dysferlin’s structure, particularly its multiple C2 domains, is regulated by Ca²⁺. These domains enable dysferlin to bind phospholipids and interact with other proteins during membrane repair and vesicle trafficking. Furthermore:
- **Trigger for Repair:** The influx of calcium upon membrane rupture serves as the primary signal to initiate repair mechanisms.
- **Homeostasis:** Although dysferlin does not directly transport calcium, its role in calcium-dependent processes is essential. In dysferlin-deficient muscle, sustained elevations in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels are observed, which may activate proteases (e.g., calpains) and contribute to muscle fiber degeneration.
- **Signal Integration:** By mediating vesicle fusion and membrane repair in a calcium-dependent manner, dysferlin helps maintain normal muscle cell function and integrity.


**Cellular Inflammation**  
Beyond its role in muscle repair, dysferlin is involved in modulating the inflammatory response:
- **Cytokine and Chemokine Secretion:** Tissues lacking dysferlin exhibit reduced secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which are critical for immune cell recruitment.
- **Immune Cell Dynamics:** In dysferlin-deficient tissues, immune cells tend to arrive later but remain longer, contributing to a prolonged inflammatory response.

Monocytes, which express dysferlin during development, internalize the protein upon differentiation. Dysferlin may form complexes with integrins, facilitating monocyte adhesion and migration. Furthermore, dysferlin-mediated release of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) during muscle repair can regulate pro-inflammatory signaling. In the absence of dysferlin, these regulatory mechanisms may be disrupted, leading to persistent inflammation.

In summary, dysferlin plays multifaceted roles in muscle physiology, from facilitating myoblast fusion and T-tubule formation to ensuring efficient vesicle trafficking, membrane repair, and modulating inflammation. Further research is needed to fully elucidate these complex processes.

### 1.3. Dysferlinopathy

Dysferlinopathies are a group of muscular dystrophies caused by dysferlin deficiency. These diseases predominantly affect skeletal muscle and exhibit a broad clinical spectrum. Over the past twenty years, significant advances have been made in understanding their pathophysiology, improving diagnosis and clinical management, and developing therapeutic strategies.

There are several types of dysferlinopathy. The two main forms are:

- **Miyoshi Myopathy (MM):** Typically presents during adolescence or around the age of 20. Patients initially experience weakness in the posterior calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus), which may later progress to involve the posterior thigh and hip girdle. Weakness in the forearm extensors may occur, while muscles such as the brachioradialis and intrinsic hand muscles are usually spared. The progression of MM is highly variable.
- **Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type R2 (LGMDR2, formerly LGMD2B):** Affects the pelvic and scapular girdles, with proximal lower limb muscles (e.g., biceps femoris, semimembranosus, adductor magnus) initially involved, followed by upper limb muscles (e.g., biceps, pectoralis major). Onset is typically between 15 and 35 years, and the progression is generally slow, though variable.

Other atypical forms include:
- **Distal Tibialis Anterior Myopathy:** Characterized by progressive weakness of the anterior tibial muscles, wrist and finger flexors, and biceps brachii, often leading to loss of ambulation between 30 and 50 years.
- **Paradas-Type Congenital Myopathy:** Manifests early (from birth to two months) with weakness of the lower limbs and neck flexors, resulting in delayed motor development.

Common clinical features across dysferlinopathies include:
- **Muscle Weakness and Atrophy:** The initial symptom is often muscle weakness, which can lead to difficulty climbing stairs, standing, or walking. Progressive necrosis of muscle fibers contributes to ongoing atrophy.
- **Histopathological Changes:** Muscle biopsies typically reveal inflammation, fibrosis, variable muscle fiber size, and central nucleation (indicative of degeneration/regeneration). Elevated levels of creatine kinase are also commonly observed.
- **Inflammation:** An abnormal inflammatory response, including the presence of mononuclear inflammatory cells, is frequently seen.

Dysferlinopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring pathogenic variants on both alleles of the **DYSF** gene for the disease to manifest. More than 400 pathogenic variants have been identified and are distributed along the gene without a clear genotype–phenotype correlation; the same mutation can cause different clinical forms (e.g., MM in some patients and LGMDR2 in others).

Prevalence rates are low:
- Miyoshi myopathy and LGMDR2 affect approximately 1 to 9 individuals per million.
- Distal tibialis anterior myopathy and Paradas congenital myopathy affect less than 1 individual per million.

Despite the marked muscular involvement, dysferlinopathies generally do not present with extra-muscular symptoms. Patients often have normal early motor development, with symptoms emerging later and progressing over time. As the disease advances, many patients require assistive devices such as canes, walkers, or wheelchairs.

## 2. Problematic

Dysferlinopathies are rare genetic muscle diseases caused by mutations in the **DYSF** gene. This project aims to unravel the disease's pathophysiology through logical modeling. Specifically, we seek to understand how dysferlin deficiency disrupts critical muscle functions—including membrane repair, calcium homeostasis, and inflammatory responses—and ultimately leads to the clinical manifestations observed in patients. By integrating current scientific literature with high-throughput omics data, our logical model provides a framework to simulate the dynamic behavior of the involved molecular pathways. Ultimately, this model may serve as a predictive tool to identify potential therapeutic targets.
