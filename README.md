# Logical modelling of dysferlinopathies

Dysferlinopathies are rare genetic myopathies caused by mutations in the DYSF gene. The absence or malfunction of dysferlin disrupts normal muscle function, impairing the repair mechanisms of muscle cells. This disruption ultimately leads to progressive skeletal muscle weakness and degeneration.

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to understand the pathophysiology of dysferlinopathies through logical modeling. We have developed a logical model that simulates molecular impact of dysferlin mutations. 

## Repository Contents

- **The Logical Model:** A detailed representation of the muscle cell network disrupted in dysferlinopathies.
- **Analysis Pipeline:** A script for simulating the model, performing attractor analysis, assessing state reachability, and generating phenotypic interpretations.
- **Preliminary Results:** ...

## Objectives

- **Clarify Disease Progression:** Elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying dysferlinopathy.
- **Identify Therapeutic Targets:** Pinpoint critical regulatory nodes and interactions that may serve as targets for future therapeutic intervention.
